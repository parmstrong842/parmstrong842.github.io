      <title>Ep. 8 - The Eighth Episode</title>
      <description>The 8th episode. We get really, really deep into this whole Brexit thing. Really insightful takes about Jeremy Corvair and Johnathan Primbles or whoever. And the guy with the hair. We had to use a conference room so theres an echo that makes this one almost unlistenable. Thanks.</description>

      <title>Ep. 9 - Technical Difficulties</title>
      <description>(PLEASE REDOWNLOAD)Well this one's jammed packed with content folks. Jim Norton joined us for the first half, but then the second half of his episode got fucked up when I forgot to change the batteries in the four track. So our good friend Felix of Chapo Trapo House joined us and then I fucked up the second half while exporting it in Audition so please redownload this one.</description>

      <title>Ep. 10 - Killing Garfield</title>
      <description>Sorry for the delay everyone, i was actually busy at uh, the black people matter protests. I was protesting for black people so I didn't have time to upload this one, which was also delayed because Kurt Metzger rescheduled. Amber Frost (of the Baffler and some other places) joined in. Amber is cool but we wasted her insight by making her talk about gay shit that we like. We're gonna do a bonus episode this week to make up for it.</description>

      <title>Ep. 12 - Overconfidence</title>
      <description>Coming in hot off last weeks killer episode with David Cross we'd thought it'd be nice to take it easy and wait till the last day possible before recording again. None of us did anything this weekend. I built a desk. I'm proud of it but you can't appreciate it over a podcast so I wasn't about to just describe the desk I built for an hour. Stav was late because he bought a sandwich.</description>

      <title>Ep. 17 - Old Friends</title>
      <description>I had to take a minute to cover some controversy that happened this week on facebook. I don't want to get into specifics but let's just say it involved a guy who may or may not be related to Seth Dickfield. Adam and stav wanted to bully me out of talking about it and they had nothing to discuss anyways so I feel like I came out the hero in this one.</description>

      <title>Ep. 25 - Playing Pretend</title>
      <description>The boys reminisce on playing pretend, old games we used to play as kids. This is about as sentimental as the show gets folks. Were trying to do more family retarded, uh excuse me i meant family RELATED content. I want to sell the podcast to Nick Jr. Teach five year olds how to say fuck and shit. And to be cool. To overcome autism and use it to hurt people.</description>

      <description>The boys offer a big huge yas queen congrats to the slay queen herself who's going to inspire little girls everywhere to be yas queens. Actually its mostly the kind of drunken political commentary you can hear in the waiting area of a Jiffy Lube. Adam gets to talk a lot on this episode because he reads the news like a bitch.</description>

      <description>As the Patreon gets closer to $5000, Adam's days are numbered. We make him defend his position on the podcast by doing another episode where I try to remember the plot of certain movies and inevitably get a detail wrong that belies my own racism.</description>

Obviously we swung into action and stav wasn't able to make an 11 am recording because he had to play video games, so we were unable to get Sam on the show!!! This is a regular episode with just the three of us! Apparently Stav doesn't realize this is a business! And you cant be complacent! I hope he slips on nutella in the shower and cracks his stupid fat fucking watermelon head on the soapdish!</description>

I didn't upload the regular episode this week cause I couldn't figure out which one's I had already uploaded. Anyhow, I'm back for a week and then I have to go back to Los Angeles for, at most, another month, (but, realistically if this WGA strike happens, only another week or so) and we're either gonna have to prerecord a bunch of episodes or go premium-only and figure out a skype thing for a bit.  I'll figure it out. I'm not stressed about it. I don't care that the show is being ruined by other opportunities. I'm fine.</description>

      <title>Bonus 40 - Stav's Toys</title>
      <description>June 12, 2017 We learn about Stav's depressing childhood, in which his family didn't have much, but at least he had teeth and hair back then. I know I keep saying the web series is coming soon - and it is. THe problem this time is that I got fat in Los Angeles and we cant film until I'm beautiful again. Not out of vanity, it just wouldn't match thec haracter i play - myself - who is beautiful and everyone wants to love.</description>

It's not a good joke. also it would have been cool if it synced up with 9/11. sike it wouldn't have. 9/11 was a huge tragedy and a lot of guys with mustaches like mine died</description>

      <title>Bonus 56 - Apologies</title>
      <description>october 15, 2017 I know the sound was messed up on the last regular episode but I looked at everything and I couldn't figure out what happened. Somehow the preferences for Audition got reset in between last week and this one and in setting my workflow back up, when I match the track volumes for the three of us it silences stavs mic. So I just monitored it while we recorded this one and didn't fuck with it afterwards. This one should be fine but if its fucked up again let me know,especially if you know how to fix it.</description>
