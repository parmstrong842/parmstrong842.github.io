    <comment>Live from Stav's office where they let us use one of the conference rooms, official Cum Boy Adam Friedland (@AdamFriedland) joins us to discuss cumming in his own face and why he can't cum on other faces now. We talk about how Muslims go to the bathroom (but not in a racist way), Youtube comments(in a racist way), Chaturbate,and Iran (also racist). Also includesa special appearance by New York comedian Seth Dickfield and other rude caricatures.</comment>

    <comment>Dan Soder (@DanSoder) is our first bonafide guest. He's got a real radio show on Sirius XM (the Bonfire),and he's on television folks (Billions, Showtime), but you can tell from our friendly rapport that he considers both me and Stav to be contemporaries, and by extension, also famous. Check out his new special on Comedy Central and buy his new album on iTunes.</comment>
