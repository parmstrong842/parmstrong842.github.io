Obviously we swung into action and stav wasn't able to make an 11 am recording because he had to play video games, so we were unable to get Sam on the show!!! This is a regular episode with just the three of us! Apparently Stav doesn't realize this is a business! And you cant be complacent! I hope he slips on nutella in the shower and cracks his stupid fat fucking watermelon head on the soapdish!</description>

Anyhow, I'm back for a week and then I have to go back to Los Angeles for, at most, another month, (but, realistically if this WGA strike happens, only another week or so) and we're either gonna have to prerecord a bunch of episodes or go premium-only and figure out a skype thing for a bit.  I'll figure it out. I'm not stressed about it. I don't care that the show is being ruined by other opportunities. I'm fine.</description>

      <description>June 12, 2017 We learn about Stav's depressing childhood, in which his family didn't have much, but at least he had teeth and hair back then. I know I keep saying the web series is coming soon - and it is. THe problem this time is that I got fat in Los Angeles and we cant film until I'm beautiful again. Not out of vanity, it just wouldn't match thec haracter i play - myself - who is beautiful and everyone wants to love.</description>

It's times like this I wish I didn't have autism so I could experience things like gratitude.</description>
